# BASIC-C-PLUS-PLUS--TASKS
These are some basic c++ tasks like hi-lo game or the problems to code without using loops 

# Problem 1:
20 years ago, FAST Islamabad campus used to store student’s CNIC numbers only, to uniquely identify them. The administration decided that they should expand its information-keeping facilities, and store other information about the students as well, such as their gender, the province, division, tehsil, and union council they belong to, and their family number.

Your task is to write a C++ Program which inputs a CNIC number, and a string name of the student. Your program will separate the relevant info and print the information in the following manner:

**Example:**

Enter Name of Student: Hamza
Enter ID of Student: 6110166903075
Gender of Hamza is: Male
Province of Hamza is: Islamabad
Division of Hamza is: Islamabad-1
District of Hamza is: Islamabad-1
Tehsil of Hamza is: Islamabad-1
Union Council of Hamza is: Islamabad-1
Family Tree of Hamza is: 6690307

# Problem 2:
Implement a game of hi-lo. First, your program should pick a random integer between 1 and 100. Your solution should handle:

- Invalid guesses (e.g. ‘x’)
- Out of bounds guesses (e.g. 0 or 101)
- Valid guesses with extraneous characters (e.g. 69x)

The user is given 5 tries to guess the number. The program should:

- Tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.
- Inform the user if they win when the correct number is guessed.
- If the user runs out of guesses, tell them they lost and reveal the correct number.

# Problem 3:
You were orphaned at an early age. To make ends meet, you sought work in a local toy car workshop in your city. Your job is to build toy cars from a collection of parts. Each toy car needs:
- 4 wheels
- 1 car body
- 2 figures of people to be placed inside

You want to find out how many complete toy cars you can make, given the total number of wheels, car bodies, and figures available.

# Problem 4:
A shape with four vertices and sides is known as a quadrilateral. Square, rectangle, kite, rhombus, trapezium, and parallelogram are all quadrilaterals. Write a C++ program for guessing the type of the quadrilateral. 

Your program should ask boolean (Y/N) questions to guess the correct quadrilateral. Both Y/y should be treated as 'Yes'.

**Example:**

Think of a quadrilateral from square, rectangle, kite, rhombus, trapezium, and parallelogram and I will guess it....
Let’s start
Q1. Are all sides equal? (Y or N) Y
Q2. Are all angles 90 degrees? (Y or N) Y
I got it! It’s a SQUARE.

# Problem 5:
You are developing software that requires the user to enter a password. The password must meet the following criteria:

- The password should be at least six characters long.
- It should contain at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.
- It should have at least one digit.

Write a program that asks for the password and verifies that it meets the stated criteria.

# Problem 6:
Check whether a given number is a power of 2 using the bitwise operator. A binary number that is a power of 2 has only **one** bit set to `1` in its binary representation. 

**Examples:**
- 2 = 0010
- 4 = 0100
- 8 = 1000
- 16 = 10000

---

# Problem 7:
Check whether a number is even or odd **without using loops, arithmetic operators, or comparison operators**.

---

# Problem 8:
You are working in an embedded systems software team where your primary goal is speed. You notice that multiplication and division slow down your program. A core functionality of your program is computing the average of numbers. Your goal is to find the average of two numbers **without using arithmetic operators**.

---

# Problem 9:
Write a C++ program that gives the largest number using the ternary operator among:

1. Three numbers, taken as input from the user.
2. Four numbers, taken as input from the user.

---

# Problem 10:
Attempt the following by writing C++ code and using conditional operators to determine:

a. Whether the character entered through the keyboard is a lowercase alphabet or not.  
b. Whether a character entered through the keyboard is a special symbol or not.  
c. Write a program using conditional operators to determine whether a year entered through the keyboard is a leap year or not.
